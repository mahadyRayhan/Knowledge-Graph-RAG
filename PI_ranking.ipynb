Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions.

This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups.

Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions.

         "Standard Grant MRI: Acquisition of a High-Performance Computational System for OAK Region to Enable Computing and Data Driven Discovery This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists.

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "Understanding the solar wind is crucial to space weather science and forecasting because the properties of the solar wind plasma affect the local conditions in the space environment around Earth. These conditions are largely the result of the speed, structure, and magnetic fields carried by the solar wind plasma. This project addresses the Solar, Heliospheric, and Interplanetary Environment (SHINE) goal of understanding the solar wind, through research that utilizes modern Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and big data analysis algorithms to analyze space-based and NSF-funded ground based coronagraph observations. The project is led by an early career female scientist and is cross-disciplinary, building a collaboration between solar physicists and data scientists. Graduate and undergraduate student researchers from under-represented groups in STEM will be supported.\r\n\r\nThe project is a four-year research program that applies state-of-the-art AI/ML technology to in-situ solar wind measurements from past, current, and future missions. The goal is to classify solar wind types and to determine their coronal source regions, to understand the physical connection between the solar wind’s in-situ properties and their coronal origins. The team will use available observations from NASA space-based missions including the Advanced Composition Explorer, Wind, Parker Solar Probe, Ulysses and when available, Solar Orbiter (SO) 1. Spectroscopic data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory and SO will provide magnetic field geometry and basic plasma diagnostics of the solar wind source regions. Furthermore, NSF-funded ground based coronagraphs such as CoMP (2011-2018), MK4 (1998-2013), KCor (2013-today) and, when available, UCoMP2 will be used to provide additional solar context data and plasma diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal is to classify solar wind types and to determine their coronal source regions, to understand the physical connection between the solar wind’s in-situ properties and their coronal origins. The team will use available observations from NASA space-based missions including the Advanced Composition Explorer, Wind, Parker Solar Probe, Ulysses and when available, Solar Orbiter (SO) 1. Spectroscopic data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory and SO will provide magnetic field geometry and basic plasma diagnostics of the solar wind source regions. Furthermore, NSF-funded ground based coronagraphs such as CoMP (2011-2018), MK4 (1998-2013), KCor (2013-today) and, when available, UCoMP2 will be used to provide additional solar context data and plasma diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

         "This project will acquire and deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) system to serve the researchers and educators in the broad Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas (OAK) region. Computational modeling, simulations, and data analytics are essential tools for new discoveries across all areas of science, engineering and mathematics. In particular, modern research breakthroughs are being driven by vast amounts of data enabled by computing and memory capacity, often combined with machine-learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. This system will seed the growth of a collaborative HPC ecosystem in the region, serving the needs of experienced users and enabling first time users, especially from small and under-served institutions. Technical know-how exchange, regular seminars, and conferences will promote collaborative research endeavors of regional and national importance. Hands on training of graduate, undergraduate and high-school students in computational and data sciences will broadly improve the skill-sets of the science and engineering workforce in the OAK region.  \r\n\r\nThe deployed system will harness the power of the latest CPUs, cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), 100 Terabytes of aggregate memory, an HDR InfiniBand interconnect, and Petabyte-scale high-speed storage. This system consisting of several types of nodes (CPUs-only, mid-range GPUs, and high-end GPUs) will provide close to 100 million-core hours of computing and will serve as a vital regional resource for science and engineering research. Initial research areas to be served by the system include biology, human and animal health, agriculture, environment research, chemistry and chemical engineering, semiconductor materials research, cybersecurity and social network modeling, renewable energy research, seismology, high-energy physics, and medical physics. This significantly improved computing and data analysis capabilities provided by this system will greatly benefit scientific productivity. Furthermore, the instrument will make it possible for faculty to include HPC and data analysis techniques in the STEM education curriculum, leading to computational thinking becoming a part of research in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Lowering the barrier of entry to HPC will also help improve the education and training of women, minorities and under-represented groups. This system will also contribute computing resources beyond the OAK region through collaborative mechanisms such as the Partnership to Advance Throughput computing (PATh) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

      "The ranking prioritizes individuals who demonstrate strength across *multiple* criteria for influence.

Dhabaleswar K Panda, Jiliang Tang, and Sharad Mehrotra follow, showing solid performance with particular strengths in different areas like fields, collaborators, or institutions. Mahmut T Kandemir and Aditya Akella have weaker overall profiles based on the metrics. Ferdinando Fioretto and Ravi Netravali have the lowest counts in key network size metrics (collaborators/projects), placing them lower. Yanfang Ye, despite strong project engagement, is ranked low because the definition explicitly includes \"wide range of different institutions,\" a criterion where their profile is significantly weaker than all others.\n"
