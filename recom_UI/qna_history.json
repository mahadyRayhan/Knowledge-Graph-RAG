        "explanation": "The answer was generated using a multi-step process: 1. An LLM interpreted your question to generate a specific Cypher query for our Neo4j graph database. 2. This query was executed against the graph to retrieve the most relevant data (the 'Retrieved Context'). 3. The retrieved data and the original question were passed back to the LLM to synthesize a final, human-readable answer."
